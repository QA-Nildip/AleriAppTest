### Environment Setup

1. Global Dependencies
    * [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Or Install Python with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
    ```
    $ brew install python
    ```
    * Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for package installation

2. Project
	* The recommended way to run your tests would be in [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). It will isolate the build from other setups you may have running and ensure that the tests run with the specified versions of the modules specified in the requirements.txt file.

	```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```
	* Create a virtual environment in your project folder the environment name is arbitrary.

	```bash
    virtualenv venv
    ```

	* Activate the environment:

	```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
	* Install the required packages:

	```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running Tests:  
---
```-v``` will give you verbose output of the test while if you want the test results then you should use the ```--alluredir=/tmp/my_allure_results```

*  To execute test:

    ```bash
    pytest -v Tests\login_test.py --alluredir=Reports/test
    ```

*  To generate report:

    ```bash
    allure serve Reports/test/
    ```
    
Make sure that you configure your interpreter pointing towards created virtual environment.
#####  Routing traffic through your local machine
- Set tunnel value to `True` in test capabilities
> OS specific instructions to download and setup tunnel binary can be found at the following links.
>    - [Windows](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+Windows)
>    - [Mac](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+MacOS)
>    - [Linux](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+Linux)

Important Note:
---
- Some Safari & IE browsers, doesn't support automatic resolution of the URL string "localhost". Therefore if you test on URLs like "http://localhost/" or "http://localhost:8080" etc, you would get an error in these browsers. A possible solution is to use "localhost.lambdatest.com" or replace the string "localhost" with machine IP address. For example if you wanted to test "http://localhost/dashboard" or, and your machine IP is 192.168.2.6 you can instead test on "http://192.168.2.6/dashboard" or "http://localhost.lambdatest.com/dashboard".
